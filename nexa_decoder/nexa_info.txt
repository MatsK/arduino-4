Observations of the 433MHz Nexa communication
=============================================

The receiver is noisy. When there is no signal, the output from the
receiver seems to be random noise. However, when a Nexa command is being
transmitted, the signal seems "somewhat less noisy". There seems to be a
fairly regular pulse train, often ending for a LOW state for up to ~100ms,
before the signal reverts to noise.

During a command sequence, the HIGH states are usually 300-400µs long,
while the LOW states are either ~200µs, ~1200µs, ~2600µs, or 10000µs long.

- A command sequence has at least 3 repetitions of the same command.
- Each command starts with ~10.2ms LOW pulse
- Each command is ~77-81ms long and consists of exactly 132 L/H pulses
- Between repeated commands, corresponding pulses deviates less than 100µs
  from their average.
- Between repeated commands, the total command length deviates less than
  60µs from the average.

- All HIGH pulses are on average ~310µs long, within ~248µs to ~432µs.
- All LOW pulses fall into one of the following categories (pulse lengths
  are given as min / avg / max in µs):
	A. 10080 / 10150 / 10208 (One per command, This is the first LOW
				  pulse that introduces the command)
	B.  2592 /  2643 /  2692 (One per command, This is the second LOW
				  pulse in every command)
	X.  1132 /  1236 /  1300 (There are 32 of these in every command)
	Y.    44 /   215 /   284 (There are 32 of these in every command)

The shorter LOW-pulses (X and Y) always appear in pairs (obviously with
HIGH pulses in between), either X followed by Y, or Y followed by X.

So we seem to have the following sync pattern introducing each command:
                                           ____                  ____
  ________________________________________|    |________________|    |
                  ~10 150µs               ~310µs    ~2 643µs    ~310µs

Or abbreviated to: A-H-B-H

Furthermore we have two more waveform, combinations of which make up the
rest of the command:
         ____                  ____
     ___|    |________________|    |
 ~215µs ~310µs    ~1 236µs    ~310µs

Abbreviated to: Y-H-X-H
                      ____     ____
     ________________|    |___|    |
        ~1 236µs  ~310µs ~215µs ~310µs

Abbreviated to: X-H-Y-H

Let's assume these waveforms represents one data bit each, and let's
arbitrarily call them the 0-bit and 1-bit, respectively.

We can then summarize our findings as follows:
- Each command starts with the following sync pattern: A-H-B-H
- Then follows 32 data bits, each bit formatted as:
	0: Y-H-X-H
	1: X-H-Y-H
- Each command is repeated at least thrice.

From this, we can start constructing an algorithm for decoding the
incoming signal into 32-bit command packets.
